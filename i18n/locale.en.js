        "Newborn jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) affects about 60% of term babies in the first week. It's caused by normal breakdown of fetal red blood cells. The liver is just catching up. Most cases are mild and resolve without treatment. It becomes a concern when bilirubin levels are very high (risk of brain damage at extreme levels) or when baby is very sleepy, not feeding, or the jaundice appears in the first 24 hours. Your hospital will check bilirubin before discharge and at the 2–5 day pediatrician visit. Treatment with phototherapy (bili lights) is very effective if needed."

Delaying the bath also helps maintain body temperature, supports blood sugar stability, and is associated with improved breastfeeding initiation. Waiting is the current best practice, not just preference."
